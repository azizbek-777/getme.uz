            <Tool title="16” MacBook Pro, M1 Max, 64GB RAM (2021)">
              I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
              difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
              single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it
              through with our various launch simulations.

            <Tool title="VS Code">
              Simple, powerful, and highly extensible, it&apos;s my coding Swiss Army
              knife.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Docker">
              My magic container tool. It lets me package and deploy
              applications seamlessly, making development and deployment a
              breeze.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Postman">
              Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
              building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
              over the years.

            <Tool title="Figma">
              We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become
              our virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have
              expected the collaboration features to be the real hook.

              It’s not the newest kid on the block but it’s still the fastest.
              The Sublime Text of the application launcher world.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Reflect">
              Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
              organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
              Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
              discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
              daily note.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="SavvyCal">
              Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar
              and making sure I still have lots of time for deep work during the
              week.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Focus">
              Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just
              do the work and get some momentum going.
